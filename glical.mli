module Kernel : module type of Glical_kernel
include module type of Kernel

module SSet : Set.S with type elt = String.t
(** Set of strings. *)

(** [channel_contents ic] eats all contents of [ic] and returns it as
    a string. Beware: if the contents is very big, it might fail,
    cf. [Sys.max_string_length] *)
val channel_contents : in_channel -> string

(** [file_contents filename] eats all contents of [filename] and returns it as
    a string. Beware: if the contents is very big, it might fail,
    cf. [Sys.max_string_length] *)
val file_contents : string -> string

(** [simple_cat ic oc] reads some iCalendar data from [ic] and outputs
    it on [oc]. Note that this fails if there are syntax errors. *)
val simple_cat : in_channel -> out_channel -> unit

(** [extract_assocs ?kl ?ks ?k ical] returns the iCalendar values that
    are associated with the keys specified in [kl], [ks] and/or [k].
    Empty blocks are not kept. *)
val extract_assocs :
  ?kl:key list ->
  ?ks:SSet.t ->
  ?k:string ->
  ([> `Raw of string ] as 'a) Ical.t ->
  'a Ical.t

(** [extract_values ?kl ?ks ?k ical] is like [extract_assocs ?kl ?ks
    ?k ical] except that it returns a list of values instead. *)
val extract_values :
  ?kl:key list ->
  ?ks:SSet.t ->
  ?k:string ->
  ([> `Raw of string ] as 'a) Ical.t ->
  'a Ical.value list

(** [list_keys_rev ical] is like [list_keys ical] except that the
    result is reversed and performs faster. *)
val list_keys_rev :
  [> `Raw of string ] Ical.t -> string list

(** [list_keys ical] returns the list of keys from [ical].
    Each key only appears once. *)
val list_keys :
  [> `Raw of string ] Ical.t -> string list

(** [list_keys_ordered ?compare ical] is like [list_keys ical] except
    that the result is ordered according to [String.compare] unless
    [~compare] is specified. *)
val list_keys_ordered :
  ?compare:(string -> string -> int) ->
  [> `Raw of string ] Ical.t -> string list

(** [combine ical1 ical2] returns the combination of
    the two iCalendars [ical1] and [ical2]. *)
val combine :
  ([> `Raw of string ] as 'a) Ical.t ->
  'a Ical.t -> 'a Ical.t


(** [combine_many icals] returns the combination of
    the all iCalendars of [icals]. *)
val combine_many :
  ([> `Raw of string ] as 'a) Ical.t list ->
  'a Ical.t
