    matching [Block _] if you want the elements of the block to be
    filtered, otherwise the entire block will be discarded.
    If you want to make sure that you don't end up with empty
    blocks, you should apply [filter] twice (the second time to
    remove empty blocks). *)

    The first [k] and [v] given to [f] are the first pair
    of (key*value) met when browsing [ical]. It's similar to

    in practice it means that the values ens with an additional Z character
    if you compare to localtime; and [`TZID s] where the timezone
    is encoded in the string [s]. [`TZID s] is used when the date-time
